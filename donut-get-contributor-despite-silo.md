## Incentive mechanisms to foster voluntary contribution

## Problem

In hierarchical and silo-organized organizations, get voluntary contributions in InnerSource
projects can be challenging. It is crucial to create  mechanisms to incentivize managers foster
voluntary contributions. Consider the following story. Company A has started an InnerSource 
initiative. Their InnerSource concept expected to have associates voluntarily contributing 
to InnerSource projects, regardless of topic and if there is a business alignment with contributor's
home business unit. 
After some time in activity, the core team realizes that their InnerSource project is not getting 
voluntary contributions. While engaging with potential individual contributors, the 
core team (pattern link) has consistently learned that the contributors in question were
not allowed to contribute or have their participation to the InnerSource project rejected by 
their respective line managers. The reasons presented by the management are: (i) the lack of strategic 
alignment between the InnerSource project goal and the business unit product/service portfolio,
(ii) managers have planned their developer's capacity 100% to the home business units projects.
So, the management is not motivated to provide their scarce developer capacity to the
InnerSource project.

As a result, the total number of contributors remained restricted to the core team and the
project cannot build a community of developers. Furthermore, contributions mostly originated
in the same business unit the Dedicated Community Leader (link to Dedicated Community Leader)
belonged to. Innovation did not happen in the expected scale. Top management is no longer
convinced that InnerSource yields the expected benefits and abandons the initiative altogether.

## Context

- The InnerSource initiative is sponsored (budget) by top level management.
- The managers (middle-management) have their bonus directly depending
only on business units results under their responsibility 
- The capacity of every associate is usually planned by their superiors
and 100% allocated to the home business unit projects
- Cross organizational collaboration is not the norm.
- Contributions to InnerSource projects are expected to be made during working
  hours.

## Forces

- Managers of business units are held accountable for their results. Reducing
  the capacity of an associate contributing to an InnerSource project rather
  than the goals of the business unit will make it harder for them to reach or
  exceed their goals.
- The more time an associate spends on contributions to an InnerSource project
  which does not benefit his day-to-day work, the more will the workload for
  his teammates in his business unit increase.
- The individual contributor would like to participate to enhance his
  professional network within the company and gain knowledge and experience
  with both the InnerSource method and the technical area he makes a
  contribution to.

## (Possible) Solution

- The top management sets and communicates a corporate strategy where development 
  capacity are to be planned and committed to a maximum of 85% to home business units projects
- A central funded formal contracting mechanisms, where line managers get
  refunded by the percentage of associates work time in InnerSource is in place.
- Managers (middle-management) have a percentage of their bonus associated to 
  contribution and the results of InnerSource projects not directly related/sponsored 
  by their business units.

## Resulting Context

- The top management communication of the strategic decision to plan and commit 
  85% of developers capacity and have 15% buffer for other company iniciatives,
  for instance InnerSource projects, shows their support and sets a clear sign
  that InnerSource is part of the corporate goal and get executive air cover.
- Allocation of corporate funds to business units for reimbursement of 
  development capacity makes easier for business units to contribute to InnerSource
  projects without to commit their cost center budget.
- Setting the bonus of middle-management partially depending on contributions and the success 
  of InnerSource projects, motivates managers to encourage their developers participate on those 
  projects 
- With a stable group of contributors, it is more likely that some of them will
  eventually achieve trusted committer status and the InnerSource project will be able
  to establish a healthy community around their project.
