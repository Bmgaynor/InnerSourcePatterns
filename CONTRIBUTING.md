# Where to start if your new

First, checkout our complete list of patterns: [public GitHub](https://github.com/paypal/InnerSourcePatterns#reviewed-patterns-proven-and-reviewed) OR [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17KPZdCoquTnYSj03pX4v2vn8lrSYO_6HK20u1cwaLPg/edit#gid=0)

We encourage beginners seeking answers to jump in by creating `donut` patterns (filling in the problem, context, forces and resulting context fields but leaving the solution blank) as a way of asking the InnerSource Commons community for help (to find a proven solution or to brainstorm things to try). 

Anyone can offer reviews and comments for [in-progress patterns](https://github.com/paypal/InnerSourcePatterns/pulls). We encourage experts to pad their experience - these are hoped to become part of an Inner Source handbook one day.

We work together via GitHub, WebEx, Slack, etc. Do not hesitate to join the [#innersourcecommons](https://isc-inviter.herokuapp.com/) or #innersource-patterns Slack channels and ask to be included in the [patterns meetings](/meta/meetings.md) (there is an email list).
