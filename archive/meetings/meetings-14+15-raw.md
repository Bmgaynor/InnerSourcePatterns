2017-03-23 (Thursday)

## Agenda

  * Introductions if new people are present
  * The book on InnerSource Patterns that Daniel is setting up
  * Expanding the team
  * Preparations for the Spring Summit
* Remaining 40 minutes
  * k: Early-Idea "Hiring leverages culture" for initial discussion.
  * g: Start as Experiment / Contained InnerSource (proven pattern)
  * ~~l: Change Developers Mindset (unproven idea)~~

## Minutes

### SUMMARY
* Some discussion around the book that l has set up (prototype). The mechanism is great; we need to add a strong disclaimer and note the Creative Commons licensing. Further discussions will likely happen in Geneva.

* e mentioned the possibility of using PayPal O’Reilly webinar credit to have us do an InnerSource Patterns webinar with them. The team here is interested in pursuing this (after the Spring Summit).

* Our group will pursue getting more patterns ready for possible sharing at the Spring Summit. We will also look into submitting some finished patterns to PLOP or EuroPLOP (for patterns feedback).

* We spent time with k’s pattern idea (early): Hiring Leverages (InnerSource) Culture; and reviewing g’s new pattern: Start as Experiment. g will bring back Contained InnerSource.

* Next week’s meeting: same time/day: WebEx: 2017-03-30 (THURS) - 9 AM PDT/11 AM CDT/5 PM CET/6 PM EET/9:30 PM INDIA

### DETAILED DRAFT NOTES
In attendance
m, o, g, n, k, b, d, a

* b: Colleague had some specific comments (from the webinar).
    – "Session was quite good; graphics for the forces were very good."
### First 20 minutes
* The book on InnerSource Patterns that l is setting up

* k: l is working with c to get this hosted under Paypal space; can bring in one markdown file that points to other markdown files; then it automatically creates the book. Once we have patterns we can publish, it should be simple
* m: Some unreviewed patterns appear in the book; we should be careful to have disclaimers so that people won’t misinterpret the contents..
* k: We have to be careful what is there (it is a proof of concept); he's aware that these patterns aren't even close to being ready for the book.
* m: Writing a book around the patterns? E.g., Fearless Change had a lot of anecdotes and discussion around each pattern.
* b: Yes, be careful (patterns not reviewed). But would be useful to extract everything into a PDF (a good thing long term). Patterns should be standalone; think about the reader of the pattern. They will read just the pattern, not the discussion. Fearless change discussions are part of the pattern. But there should be appropriate introductions. Stories should be part of the pattern or people won't read them.
    – m: We should add a disclaimer page to the book (for now).
    – b: Creative Commons license should be on each page.

### PLOP
* b: We should take a few of the best, complete patterns to PLOP or EuroPLOP and see what others outside the InnerSource community are thinking; external feedback.

### Expanding the team
* O'Reilly InnerSource Patterns webinar?
    – yes, there is interest if e wants us to push this
* d: Will watch the Webinar youtube and distribute the links internally to folks interested in this topic
* b: Some progress can be made with the core that exists
* k: There should be a surge of interest after the summit

#### Preparations for the Spring Summit
* m: 2.5 hours: 1.5 hours in morning; 1 hour in the afternoon (break-out session). Will be in touch to talk about how we will organize this.
* g: might have something to present in Geneva
* n: Haven't seen the agenda

* In general:
    – Short InnerSource 101 and 102
    – Measuring Success

    – Psychological Safety and Learning
    – Honeymoon effect
    – Designing your first experiment
    – Strategy development workshop
