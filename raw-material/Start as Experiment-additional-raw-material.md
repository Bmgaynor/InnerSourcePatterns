##### g: Start as Experiment InnerSource (proven pattern)
* Ref: https://github.com/paypal/InnerSourcePatterns/pull/66
* Contained InnerSource pattern
* Related to Review Committee
* Mechanism to kickstart InnerSource
* Declare InnerSource to be an experiment in the beginning
* Problem: most managers have no experience with open source methods and don't want to invest people/time/money in it
* We are traditionally not a SW company (coming from manufacturing); little to no open source.
* Idea of InnerSource is popular with developers (they are familiar with open source). Many of our products now use open source.
* The way we sold IS to managers: would increase the efficiency of global development (very few projects only happen in one site). Efficiency is a problem. They want to validate these claims about efficiencies; we don't have numbers yet to support this.
* If there is a lot of uptake on IS, it would be hard to shut it down (fear)
* regulatory and legal problems
* Solutiok: declare it as a time-limited experiment (we did ours for 3 years)
    – what the outcomes should be
    – combined with Review Committee pattern (gave management some influence on what was going on)
* Resulting contexm: managers are willing to kick off InnerSource and fund it
    - declaring it an experiment relieves the need to scrutinize numbers
    – saying it could fail makes it easier to sign off on
    – even in the case of failure, it will be clear that we've learned something useful
* k: At the three year mark?
* g: We had no measurements for proposed efficiency gain (2x) but it was very obvious it was beneficial so they continued to fund it (so many benefits).
* p: How did you know it was successful? Did you have clear KPIs or measurements that indicated it was successful?
* g: No, not aware of what KPIs were used to show this. I will look for more information on this.
* p: This reminds me of the Trial Run pattern.
    – "Trial run" by Mary Lynn Manns and Linda Rising in "Fearless Change" book, p. 245
* b: Reminds me of many things in Fearless Change (for getting patterns going).
* g: It has helped us a lot (developers got the right perspective); if you declare it an experiment, it issues a challenge to the developers to make it work.
* k: Important to classify your type of company. At the last OSCON, I remember hearing: you can do it grass roots or top down.
* g: I think you need both; if no uptake at developer, top down won't work. If only grass roots, it is also doomed.

* m: Would still like to see the Contained InnerSource pattern written. A way for two product lines to contribute resources to collaboratively write common software (using open source tools and methods).
* g: The SW is usually not shared with Contained InnerSource. The BU that did this is now joining our platform with 3000 developers--this went all the way up to the Board level. Will work more on this (reopen the PR).

* n: If this is proven, it could be helpful to people. Part of the solution should be to design and communicate criteria for evaluating the experiment. Some data should be included here (proven example).
* k: Even if qualitative instead of quantitative.
* g: Okay. I'll add something in there.
