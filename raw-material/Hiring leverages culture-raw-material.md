##### k: Early-Idea "Hiring leverages culture" for initial discussion.
* Hiring HR practices can be benefited from innerSource and open source practices
* Employee retention too
* Something outside of the engineering organization, to get other parts of business involved
* Better quality engineers are active in open source
* For internal people inside the company
* some are afraid of it (they may get to learn and like it)
* some love it (they are more social)
* todo group is tracking open source office positions (insight into how companies are thinking about people to interact in these ways)
* Will start a repository listing Jobs that post positions mentioning InnerSource
* Have you seen this in your companies?
* Problem statement?

* b: thinking about the software craftsmanship movemenm: open source development being sexy; people asking for your github repository; companies training apprentices. Getting back to the ancient days where people are writing good quality SW rather than just hacking it out. A reaction to waterfalls and to Agile (let's plan it and do it really well and become masters at writing this code). Giving a short talk on this to the TLC in June (internal to our company).
* g: Our HR isn't using InnerSource in their hiring; but some have said that the only reason they stayed was to participate in InnerSource. And some people switched jobs in my company to continue to work in InnerSource. HR is figuring out ways to make our company more attractive to SW engineers. InnerSource may play a role in that.
* k: one guy put into their engineering rec positions some blurbs about InnerSource. Some may not even know the term. He put it as "internal open source". Home Away (vacation rentals) have been posting a lot in their job boards about InnerSource. Would be interesting to find someone there to join our group.
* b: Are you thinking this would go with Hiring? Retention? Or starting a new program?
* k: Probably hiring and retention.
* b: You want to hire good employees to stick around for a while.
* m: There are engineers at our company that have come in with open source experience and prefer to work in that way.
* g: Talk with xxx; I'm sure they are leveraging InnerSource in their hiring.
* n: InnerSource as a key component for attracting talent. Some engineers shared that it is a must-have, not a nice-to-have (that there will be code sharing and inner sourcing)
* k: Millennials are overtaking the job market (majority now)
* o: This can bring new talents; can also be used to show clients, to bring in new clients (talking about the projects and InnerSource). Open house concepm: bringing in people to tour. People come to me and talk about our InnerSource community. Clients are curious. Many aren't familiar with InnerSource but are fascinated by the concept.
* b: n, I'll be happy to shepherd your **pattern**
